Description:
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints 
of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

Solution 1:O(N)
The area depends on two things, the width of container and minimum of height of two rods.We first start by considering the container with maximum width, the start
to decrease the width.If we want to increase the height of container then we must discard the rod with smallest height among two because dicarding lager will not
increase the area.
int Solution::maxArea(vector<int> &v) 
{
    int n=v.size();
    int left=0,right=n-1;
    int ans=0;
    while(left<right)
    {
        ans=max(ans,(right-left)*min(v[right],v[left]));
        if(v[left]<v[right])
            left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return ans;
}
