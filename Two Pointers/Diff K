Description:
Given an array ‘A’ of sorted integers and another non negative integer k, find if there exists 2 indices i and j such that A[i] - A[j] = k, i != j.

Code:
Solution 1: 
Use hasing O(N) time O(N) space

Solution 2:O(N lg N) time O(1) space
Use Binary Search for each v[i]+k from i+1 to n-1

Solution 3:
O(N) time O(1) space
Use two pointers intialise each pointer from v[0].If diff < K then right++ else if diff > K left++ or if diff==K then left=right=increment left by 1
