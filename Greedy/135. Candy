Description:
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

Code:
Solution 1:
First give 1 candies to each student.Then scan from left to right and when the next element is greater than previous element then give him 1 more toffee.
After updating the array then scan from right to left and when the next element is greater than previous element then give him  1more toffee and update the
value as max of previous set value or new one.

class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int> &ratings) 
    {
        if(ratings.size()<=1)
            return ratings.size();
        int n=ratings.size();
        vector<int> v(n,1);
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
        {
            if(ratings[i]<ratings[i+1])
                v[i+1]=1+v[i];
        }
        for(int i=n-1;i>0;i--)
        {
            if(ratings[i-1]>ratings[i])
                v[i-1]=max(v[i-1],v[i]+1);
        }
        int sum=0;
        for(auto x:v)
            sum+=x;
        return sum;
    }
};
