Description:
Given the array of strings A,you need to find the longest string S which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.
Longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1
and S2.

Code:
Solution 1:Sort the array of strings.Then the longest common prefix is common in 1st and last.
string Solution::longestCommonPrefix(vector<string> &v) 
{
    if(v.size()==1)
        return v[0];
    sort(v.begin(),v.end());
    string ans="";
    int n=v.size();
    for(int i=0;i<v[0].size();i++)
        if(v[0][i]==v[n-1][i])
        ans+=v[0][i];
        else break;
    return ans;
}
Solution 2:Use Trie Data Structure
Solution 3:Using Character by cahracter matching
