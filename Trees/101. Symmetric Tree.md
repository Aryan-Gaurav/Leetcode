Dscription:
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
 

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
 

Follow up: Solve it both recursively and iteratively.

Code:
Solution:1
In left part when you go left then to check in right part go right and vice-versa.

class Solution {
public:
    bool helper(TreeNode *p,TreeNode* q)
    {
        if(p==NULL or q==NULL)
            return p==q;
        if(p->val!=q->val)
            return 0;
        return helper(p->left,q->right) and helper(p->right,q->left);
    }
    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        return helper(root,root);
    }
};

Solution 2:
Iteratively
Idea is to use a stack and push left child and right child and always pop 2 elements and check.
