Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
1.Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
2.The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Code:
Solution 1:
int Solution::searchMatrix(vector<vector<int> > &v, int val) 
{
    int n=v.size(),m=v[0].size();
    int low=0,high=m*n-1;
    while(low<=high)
    {
        int mid=(low+high)/2;
        if(v[mid/m][mid%m]==val)
            return 1;
        if(v[mid/m][mid%m]<val)
            low=mid+1;
        else high=mid-1;
    }
    return 0;
}
