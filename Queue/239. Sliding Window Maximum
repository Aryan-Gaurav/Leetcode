Description:
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. 
You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

Could you solve it in linear time?

Example:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
Explanation: 

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
1 <= k <= nums.length

Code:
Solution 1:
Brute Force approach in time O(N*K)

Solution 2:
Using BSTs like multimap time complexity O(N lg K)
Just insert the first k elements in the multimap and then find its maximum.For the next window just remove the 1st element and add K+1 th element and again find
maximum.
vector<int> Solution::slidingMaximum(const vector<int> &v, int k) 
{
    int n=v.size();
   multiset<int,greater<int>> mp; //so that maximum is at top of BST
   for(int i=0;i<k;i++)
    mp.insert(v[i]);
    vector<int> ans(n-k+1);
    ans[0]=*mp.begin();
    for(int i=0;i<n-k;i++)
    {
        mp.erase(mp.find(v[i]));  //1st i used mp.erase(v[i]) but it erases all instances of v[i] whereas we want to delete only one
        mp.insert(v[i+k]);
        ans[i+1]=*mp.begin();
    }
    return ans;
}

Solution 3:
Using Doubly-Ended Queue in time O(N+K).
Main idea in this approach is to maintain the potential maximum elements candidates.If the array is in increasing order then the maximum is known to be the last
element, rest of them are not even candidates for being as maximum because the length of window is greater than their width so they will be fully or partially 
covered from right.So the maximum is ought to be the rightmost element. So we maintian a monotonic decreasing queue and at a time their can be atmost K elements
in this queue.We push indicies from back and when we get more than k elements or elements which are not in current window then we pop from the front.For this 
implementation we use a DEQUE.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int> &v, int k) 
    {
        int n=v.size();
        deque<int> q;
        for(int i=0;i<k;i++)
        {
            while(!q.empty() and v[i]>v[q.back()])  //this ensures montonic decreasing nature of queue
                q.pop_back();
            q.push_back(i);
        }
        vector<int> ans(n-k+1);
        for(int i=0;i<=n-k;i++)
        {
            while(!q.empty() and q.front()<i) //in front there may  be items from previous sliding windows,so remove them they are useless candidates
                q.pop_front();
            ans[i]=v[q.front()];  //after all redundant items are removed we go for the 1st elemnt of the queue
            if(i+k>=n)  //this means we have done our job break out
                break;
            while(!q.empty() and v[i+k]>v[q.back()])  //again before pushing the last element check if it is greater than previous elemnts(now it can be
                q.pop_back();                         // best candidate) 
            q.push_back(i+k);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

Solution 4:
Using DP in O(N) time.
We divide the array into parts of length k and last sub-array can be of less length too. Now we go from left to right and calculate maximum till ith pos in
a sub-array.Similarly we do from right to left.
For Example: A = [2,1,3,4,6,3,8,9,10,12,56], w=4

partition the array in blocks of size w=4. The last block may have less than w.
2, 1, 3, 4 || 6, 3, 8, 9 || 10, 12, 56||

Traverse the list from start to end and calculate max_so_far. Reset max after each block boundary (of w elements).
left_max[] = 2, 2, 3, 4 || 6, 6, 8, 9 || 10, 12, 56

Similarly calculate max in future by traversing from end to start.
right_max[] = 4, 4, 4, 4 || 9, 9, 9, 9 || 56, 56, 56

now, sliding max at each position i in current window, sliding-max(i) = max{right_max(i), left_max(i+w-1)}
sliding_max = 4, 6, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 56
                                                    -----------------
Lets consider a window which lies in two parts 2, 1,| 3, 4,||| 6, 3,| 8, 9, |||10, 12, 56|||
                                                    -----------------
We can find the maximum of this window from going right to left from 4 to 3(saved in right_to_left[2] ie i) and going from left to right from 6 to 3
(saved in left_to_right[5] ie i+k-1).

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int> &v, int k) 
    {
        int n=v.size();
        vector<int> right_to_left(n),left_to_right(n);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(i%k==0)
                left_to_right[i]=v[i];
            else left_to_right[i]=max(v[i],left_to_right[i-1]);
        }
        right_to_left[n-1]=v[n-1]; //we do to avoid overflow 
        for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--)
        {
            if(i%k==0)
                right_to_left[i]=v[i];
            else right_to_left[i]=max(v[i],right_to_left[i+1]);//here overflow may occur if last element is evaluted by this formula
        }
        vector<int> ans(n-k+1);
        for(int i=0;i<=n-k;i++)
            ans[i]=max(right_to_left[i],left_to_right[i+k-1]);
        return ans;
    }
};
