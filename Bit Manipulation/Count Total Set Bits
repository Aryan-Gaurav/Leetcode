Description:
Given a positive integer A, the task is to count the total number of set bits in the binary representation of all the numbers from 1 to A.
Return the count modulo 109 + 7.

Solution 1:
Starting from zero,we have i 0's followed by i 1's on ith bit.
int Solution::solve(int n) 
{
    const int mod=(int)(1e9+7);
    int ans=0;
    for(int i=1;i<=1+log2(n);i++)// till number of digits in binary representation
    {
        int x=((n+1)>>i)<<(i-1);  //total no. of boxes of 0 and 1 and then no. of 1 in that boxes.
        x+=max(0,(n+1)%(1<<i)-(1<<(i-1))); //remaining no. of zeroes and ones without full pairing
        ans=(ans+x)%mod;
    }
    return ans;
}
